# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About Me
Hello, I'm an embedded systems engineer who loves to build robust, and highly readable and maintainable firmware for embedded device. I've been working on embedded systems for 7+ years now.

# My Work Experience Timeline Summary

* 2022-now. Working on a Low-Earth Orbit Satellite system to provide 24/7 IoT connectivity anywhere in the world.
* 2020-2022. Built tracker device to track heavy machinery such as excavator, and super big trucks. Developed firmware to run the devices 24/7 for years.
* 2019-2020. Built tracker device for human. Using Bluetooth technology to track human movement (indoor) and presence.
* 2018-2019. Built self-checkout machine for the biggest ecommerce startup in Indonesia.
* 2016-2018. Built the tiniest smartcard reader that can be atached to Android smartphone.

# My Skill Set
* `Firmware Architecture Design`. A very important step that many engineers missed. Without proper architecture design, your firmware will be destined to be super-hard to maintain and add features.
* `Firmware Documentation`. Without proper documentation, people will waste time to understand and follow your firmware.
* `Firmware Testing`. I love and use Test-Driven Development in my day-to-day work.
* `Testing Automation`. Usually I use CI/CD to deliver fast and good firmware without breaking existing code.
* `Programming Language`. I'm fluent speaking embedded C and C++. Also able to speak Python and C#.
